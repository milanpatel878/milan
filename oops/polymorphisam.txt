//Polymorphism in OOPs is a concept that allows you to create classes with different functionalities in a single interface. Generally, it is of two types: compile-time (overloading) and run time (overriding), but polymorphism in PHP does not support overloading, or in other words, compile-time polymorphism

//Polymorphism is essentially an OOP pattern that enables numerous classes with different functionalities to execute or share a commonInterface

//    types of polymorphism
//     a) method overloading
            // method overloading is used to call same function with different argument
            // Note : its not support
//     b) method overriding

             // method overriding is used to call same function with same argument.
